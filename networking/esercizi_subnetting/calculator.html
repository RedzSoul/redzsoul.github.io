Using CIDR/VLSM this calculator allows you to quickly figure out how to most efficiently setup your network. If you are using IPv6 you can use our <a href='ipv6_subnetting.html'>IPv6 subnetting calculator</a> to efficiently setup those addresses.
<h4>Variable Length Subnet Masking Explained</h4>
<p>Variable length subnet masking (VLSM) is a more efficient way of subnetting a network. When you perform classful subnetting, all the subnets must use the same subnet mask, forcing them to each use the same number of hosts. This can lead to wasted IP space. </p>


<p>Say for example you need three subnets in a /24 network. Say you need 120 hosts in one subnet, and only 8 in the remaining two subnets. Well, with traditional subnetting, all subnets  must be the same size. The subnet which needs 120 hosts has to have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.128. No smaller subnet will allow for 120 hosts. This means the other two subnets must also have the same subnet mask, 255.255.255.128, but three such subnets do not fit into a single /24! Also, you only need 8 hosts for the second two subnets, but with a mask of 255.255.255.128 you have 126 usable hosts. that is 118 unused IP addresses. What a waste!</p>
<p>Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) has replaced the classful network design. Subnets no longer have to all be the same size. Network architects can now create multiple subnets all of which vary in size and subnet mask.</p>
<p>If you were to use CIRD/VLSM, you could easily fit all three subnets into a single /24 network. The subnet which has 120 hosts would still have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.128, but now the remaining two subnets could have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.240. These would each allow 14 usable hosts, and still leave a chunk of the original /24 to be used in the future. A much more efficient use of IP space.</p>
<p> VLSM allows you to use different subnet masks, allowing for a more exact number of hosts to be used in each subnet. To perform VLSM subnetting, starting with the largest number of hosts needed in a single subnet, find the smallest subnet which will have that many hosts. Then do the same for the subnet needing the second largest number of hosts, all the way down to the smallest number of hosts needed.</p>
<p>One common mistake in subnetting is to attempt to create something such as a 172.16.1.0/23 network. A /23 can never have a '1' in the third octet. This is because a /23 uses the first 7 bits of the third octet for the network, and the last bit for hosts. Ignoring the last bit (which is used for hosts) we can only have 172.16.0.0/23 or 172.16.2.0/23, but no /23 in between. This is an error other VLSM calculators seem to make. If in doubt, try converting to <a href="binary.html">binary</a>. Another example of this may be attempting to have a 192.168.1.1/30 network. For the same
reason as before, we can only have 192.168.1.0/30, with the next possible network being 192.168.1.4/30.</p>





<h1>Binary Decimal Hexadecimal Calculator</h1>
<form onsubmit="return false;">
	<label>Decimal:</label> <input type='text' id='dec' onkeyup='convert("dec")' placeholder='12'><br>
	<label>Binary:</label> <input type='text' id='bin' onkeyup='convert("bin")' placeholder='1100'><br>
	<label>Hexadecimal:</label> <input type='text' id='hex' onkeyup='convert("hex")' placeholder='C'><br>
</form>
<p>To convert between binary, decimal and hexadecimal simply type in the number you wish to convert from into the corresponding field. Remember that binary only allows digits of one and zero and hexadecimal allows digits from zero to the letter F. </p>
<p>Remember, IPv6 is written in hexadecimal and IPv4 in decimal. However computers use the binary version of both of these because computers only 'think' in binary. Being able to convert between the three will help with understanding computer and networking. </p>


<h2>Decimal</h2>
<p>Decimal is a system of counting using ten different symbols to represent numbers. These ten symbols or 'digits' are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. using these digits we can represent every number from zero to nine using a single one of these symbols. However, when we need to represent a larger number, like ten or eleven, we have to combine two or more of our digits. For the number ten we use the digit '1' and the digit '0', together to write '10'. For the number twenty-five we use the two digits '2' and '5'. This system is also called base-10, because it uses ten digits to express the number that we mean. The reason we use ten different digits is simply because we have ten fingers on our hands, and that is how we first began to count. That is why children can count to ten more easily than they can to fifteen. They can use their fingers to help them. </p>
<h2>Binary</h2>
<p>Binary, and other systems of representing numbers is similar to decimal, only the use a different amount of symbols or digits to represent a number. Binary is base-2, which means there are only two symbols used to represent a number; 0 and 1. So the numbers zero and the number one can be represented by a single binary digits - 0 and 1, respectively. However, for any number greater than one, binary must use more than one digit. The number two is represented by two separate digits '10'. The number three is also represented by two digits, '11'. The number four however, cannot be represented by two digits, so now binary has to use three digits. The number four is '100'. Five is '101', and so on.</p>
<p>When translating from binary, the right most digit is always going to represent a value of 'one' or 'zero', the second right most is always going to be 'two' or 'zero', the third will be 'four' or 'zero' the fifth will be 'eight' or zero, and so on. All digits place is always a exponent of the number 'two'. To really understand what is going on, n <a href='binary.html'>practice converting binary</a> and decimal back and forth.</p>
<h2>Hexadecimal</h2>
<p>Like binary, hexadecimal (or hex), is just using a different set of symbols to represent the same numbers. Hexadecimal is base-16, which means it uses sixteen different digits to represent numbers, they are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. The letters represent numbers, so 'A' is actually the number ten, and 'B' is eleven. Because hexadecimal uses more than ten digits to represent numbers, it can represent any value between zero and fifteen using only a single digits. And as with other systems, any number above fifteen is going to need more than one digit. For example, sixteen is written as '10', seventeen is '11', eighteen is '12', twenty-six '1A' and twenty-seven is '1B'.</p>
<p>Translating between the three systems, the value is always the same, it is just that the value is represented using a different set of digits.</p>

This calculator can be used for IPv6 in the same way VLSM is used to plan an IPv4 network.<br>
Remember, the <a href='ipv6_is_huge.html'>size</a> of IPv6 can be huge. This calculator can crash your browser if you attempt to have it calculate billions of subnets!<br>
Because of this, only the first 999 subnets are displayed.
</p>
<p id='subnetted'> </p>
<p>Use the above calculator to plan your IPv6 networks. Because of the huge size of IPv6, we do not care about the number of hosts in a network. Remember, that the smallest recommended subnet is a /64.</p>
